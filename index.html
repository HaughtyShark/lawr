        <h1>Welcome to the LAWR Repository Page baby i'm a dawg i'm a mutt</h1>
        <p>This is a simple GitHub Pages site for the lawr repository.</p>
        <br> <!-- This is a break element/tag -->
        <!-- And this is a comment! Comments are basically like little ways for you to leave yourself notes in your code without worrying that it will affect your site or code-->
        <p>Starting off with some pretty basic stuff for now</p>
        <p>Everything you see in the index page, and any html page you create after will have "html elements".</p>
        <p>You can think of HTML elements as building blocks to your webpage.</p>
        <h1>You can have header html elements</h1> 
        <h2>Depending on what number you put after the "h" in your element tag, the size of the header will change </h2>
        <h6>I'm not exactly sure how low it goes but this is an "h6" header element</h6>
        <p>You can have "unordered lists"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dog</li>
            <li>Cat</li>
            <li>Chicken</li>
        </ul>
        <p>or you can have "ordered lists"</p>
        <ol>
            <li>this is the first item but I didn't have to type 1. before</li>
            <li>second item</li>
            <li>you get the point</li>
        </ol>

        <p>below are links to different types of html elements that are available and supported. Basically, web pages are strucutred with a bunch of these elements and a separate type of coding, "CSS" or "Cascading Style Sheets" is used to change the actual appearance of the page with things like color, animations, size, shape, etc.</p>
